Pong Game!

Description:
This is a recreation of the classic pong game. We had some fun with it and created a monkey in the middle version and others just to have fun with an old classic of a game.

Project Structure:
The game is structured so that you when you run it you get a menu screen and you are able to select from a insturction screen and differnt versions of the game that you can play. We use a lot of the techniques from what we have learned in class to make the game easier to change and debug when we need to.

Required Software:
VS code
